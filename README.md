Hi, Iâ€™m Minh Nguyen. 

I'm interesting in anything robotics, music, tennis, or food-related, involving programming or otherwise. I'm having fun messing around with AI models and making websites, like making [Barker](https://twitter-clone-sstp.appspot.com/).

I think you can reach me through GitHub. Otherwise, I don't use social media. 

Also, I'm almost good at Rocket League, but don't @ me, because I don't have Twitter.
